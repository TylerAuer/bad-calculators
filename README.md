# Bad Calculators

Extremely puzzling and unhelpful devices

## To Do

- Add user auth with Google
- Turn calc buttons back into buttons
- Add NaN return for invalid inputes (ex: 4.2!)
- Add loading spinner
- Implement Google Sign In
- Shows total stars possible
- Log attempts
- 404 Page and redirects
- Customize stars and SuccessModal message based on result

## Ideas

- Buttons with hidden functions. So users have to deduce what the function is. Will be most fun if you play with this where start value is 2 and the output of any of the buttons is 4 because 2 + 2 = 4, 2 * 2 = 4 and 2 ^ 2 = 4.
- Buttons that change value over time. So, the first time you push the button it is +1 then +2 then +3...
