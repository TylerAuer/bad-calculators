# Bad Calculators

Extremely puzzling and unhelpful devices

## To Do

1. Turn calc buttons back into buttons
2. Add loading spinner
3. Implement Google Sign In
4. Shows total stars possible
5. Log attempts
6. Add user auth with Google
7. 404 Page and redirects

## Ideas

- Buttons with hidden functions. So users have to deduce what the function is. Will be most fun if you play with this where start value is 2 and the output of any of the buttons is 4 because 2 + 2 = 4, 2 * 2 = 4 and 2 ^ 2 = 4.
- Buttons that change value over time. So, the first time you push the button it is +1 then +2 then +3...
